# Auto-YouTube-Shorts-Maker-master
This Python script streamlines the creation of YouTube Shorts by retrieving a random joke from the r/Jokes subreddit and generating a video in which an AI narrates the joke from ElevenLabs.

You can have a gameplay video of a game or something in the background (make sure it is a long video, because it uses a random part of the video so you can have multiple different shorts.) while
the AI narrates the joke.

I've also implemented this python code to upload the file automatically to an AWS server automatically, which the AWS server uploads a video every 8 hours. You can basically automate the whole,
processing of creating a jokes video with an AI narrator from elevenLabs.
