# ðŸŽ¥ Auto-YouTube-Shorts-Maker

## Overview  
**Auto-YouTube-Shorts-Maker** is a Python-based automation tool designed to create YouTube Shorts by retrieving random jokes from the **r/Jokes** subreddit and generating videos where an AI, powered by **ElevenLabs**, narrates the jokes.

Additionally, this script supports **automated uploads to an AWS server**, which schedules video uploads every **8 hours**, allowing full automation of the content creation process.

## Features  
- âœ… **Automated Joke Retrieval** â€“ Fetches random jokes from the **r/Jokes** subreddit.  
- âœ… **AI Voice Narration** â€“ Uses **ElevenLabs** to generate high-quality AI voiceovers.  
-  **Dynamic Background Videos** â€“ Supports gameplay or any long video as a background. It selects **random segments**, enabling unique shorts from a single video source. It also adds music background if you want. 
- âœ… **Auto-subtitle generation** - Automatically detects words and generates subtitles on the screen for better engagement for the video.
- âœ… **Duplicate Detection** â€“ Ensures that the same joke is not used in multiple videos.

## How It Works  
1. **Fetch a Joke** â€“ The script retrieves a random joke from **r/Jokes**.  
2. **Generate AI Narration** â€“ The joke is converted into speech using **ElevenLabs**.  
3. **Select a Background Video** â€“ A random portion of a pre-existing long video (gameplay, stock footage, etc.) is selected.  
4. **Create the YouTube Short** â€“ The video is rendered with the AI-narrated joke.  
5. **Upload to AWS** â€“ The script automatically uploads the video to an AWS server, which then schedules it for YouTube every 8 hours.  
6. **Check for Duplicates** â€“ Before creating a new video, it verifies whether the joke has already been used.
